## Concepts and Tools Used

### Tools and Libraries
- **Python**: Core language for the project.
- **TensorFlow / PyTorch**: Frameworks for deep learning and object detection model implementation.
- **OpenCV**: For image processing and visualization.
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn**: To plot performance metrics and analysis charts.
- **Docusaurus**: For API documentation.

### Key Concepts
#### Object Detection
Detecting and localizing objects in images using bounding boxes. The goal is to predict both the *class* and *position* of objects accurately.

#### Metrics for Evaluation
1. **Intersection over Union (IoU)**:
   - Measures the overlap between the predicted bounding box and the ground truth.
   - Formula:  
     \[
     IoU = \frac{\text{Area of Overlap}}{\text{Area of Union}}
     \]
   - Thresholding IoU (e.g., IoU > 0.5) determines if a prediction is a true positive.

2. **Mean Average Precision (mAP)**:
   - Evaluates the precision and recall of the model across different IoU thresholds.
   - Higher mAP indicates better model performance.

3. **Confusion Matrix**:
   - Visual representation of model predictions (True Positives, False Positives, True Negatives, and False Negatives).
   - Helps diagnose errors and fine-tune thresholds.

#### Visual Explanation of Metrics

| Actual / Predicted | Positive Prediction | Negative Prediction |
|---------------------|----------------------|----------------------|
| **True Positive (TP)** | Detected correctly | - |
| **False Positive (FP)** | Detected incorrectly | - |
| **True Negative (TN)** | - | Not detected correctly |
| **False Negative (FN)** | - | Missed detection |
